# javascript-practice
I created projects like a calculator and a clock etc... Built small projects daily to learn and practice coding.

##  Structure
- Each project is organized in its own folder (e.g., `Day01-Calculator`, `Day02-Clock`, etc.).
- Projects are small, focused, and built for learning purposes.

##  Purpose
- To demonstrate consistency in learning and practicing coding.
- To show progress through daily uploads.
- This repo is a practice showcase, not my main work.

##  Main Projects
For my larger, polished projects, please visit my other repositories.
